&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Since the original post I made some more progress. I'm developing the code into my GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/cranmer/play/tree/master/manifoldLearning"&gt;play/manifoldLearning&lt;/a&gt; repository.  Below is from the README.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a paper about Informtion Geometry.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Since the original post I made some more progress. I'm developing the code into my GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/cranmer/play/tree/master/manifoldLearning"&gt;play/manifoldLearning&lt;/a&gt; repository.  Below is from the README.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a paper about Informtion Geometry.&lt;br&gt;
The first step was an iPython notebook on &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cranmer/play/blob/master/manifoldLearning/GaussianInformationGeometryEmbedding.ipynb"&gt;Visualizing information geometry with multidimensional scaling&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other python files are me working my way to something more ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt;
The first step is described nicely in this iPython notebook on &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cranmer/play/blob/master/manifoldLearning/GaussianInformationGeometryEmbedding.ipynb"&gt;Visualizing information geometry with multidimensional scaling&lt;/a&gt;. Final result shown here. Important part is a grid of points in (μ,σ) being mapped by f:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/gaussianInfoGeom.png" width="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt;
Try various &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/0.11/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html"&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/a&gt; algorithms, setteling on NuSVR. Results not so good, smaller red spots not approximating the larger colorful training samples, particuarly near the edges. The lower-right is what I'm ultimately after, the inverse map of back into the space (μ,σ) -- for these points, that should be a perfect grid. Surprised I can't do regression on &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/learnEmbedding.png" width="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt;
Since this is a low dimensional problem with little noise, just try &lt;a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/interpolate.html#d-interpolation-interp1d"&gt;SciPy Interpolation&lt;/a&gt; algorithms. Ah, that's better, now I'm getting the grid I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/interpEmbedding.png" width="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt;
To do: make a regular grid in the target space and project it via the inverse into the (μ,σ) plane.  This is a "smart" sampling from an information theoretic perspective. It's also a good choice if simulation of the statistical model is expensive (ie. full simulation with GEANT at the LHC, which takes about 20 min per event, and the real collisons are happening at 40 million/sec. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt;
To do: repeat exercise with MSSM SUSY grids published on HepData. Change from Gaussian to Poisson, where I can still solve for the information distance analytically. Repeat steps 3 &amp;amp; 4 for that case, evaluate embedding from information persepctive, and propose a better choice for the parameter scan "grids" used by the ATLAS collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6:&lt;/strong&gt;
To do: move to a non-number counting model, generate graph of KL distances, use shortest path on this graph (via Dijkstra's algorithm) to approximate the geodesic from the fisher information metric -- perhaps using &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html"&gt;boost libraries&lt;/a&gt; or the code from &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2050"&gt;FINE&lt;/a&gt;, amazingly &lt;a href="http://tbayes.eecs.umich.edu/kmcarter/fine_doc"&gt;the code is available&lt;/a&gt; -- nicely done Kevin Carter!&lt;/p&gt;

That made it hard to concentrate on python, but I tried to merge the two. I noticed that BICEP2 made their likelihood curve public. I also noticed that they got a bit mixed up with their Bayesian and Frequentist statistics (at least the terminology), so that gave me an idea.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are familiar with the critical role of INSPIRE in searching for
papers, following references, tracking the citations, and providing
author profiles.  Now INSPIRE is taking steps to extend this service to
data, thus creating a rich new layer to the information system of high
energy physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, papers have been the primary means for scientific
communication; however, it is common to augment papers with data.  The
Durham &lt;a href="http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk/"&gt;HepData&lt;/a&gt; project has hosted this type of data for several
years, and since last year, &lt;a href="http://blog.inspirehep.net/2012/10/hepdata-comes-to-inspire.html"&gt;HepData is integrated with INSPIRE&lt;/a&gt;.
 Some papers have several datasets associated to it, so each dataset is
given a unique, persistent Digital Object Identifier (&lt;a href="http://www.datacite.org/"&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;).  Not
only do these DOIs ensure that you can find the data, but they also
provide a clear way to &lt;a href="http://thedata.org/files/thedata_new2/files/datacitationprinciples-datacite.pdf"&gt;cite the data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at an example.  Last month, ATLAS took an important &lt;a href="http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2013/09/12/inspired-by-the-higgs-a-step-forward-in-open-access/"&gt;step
forward&lt;/a&gt; and released a digital form of the likelihood function
associated to the Higgs boson property measurements.  You can find these
likelihood functions by clicking on the Data tab of the &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1241574"&gt;ATLAS paper&lt;/a&gt;.
 There are three datasets associated to this paper, and each has its own
DOI.  For instance, the H→γγ likelihood's DOI
is  &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.7484/INSPIREHEP.DATA.A78C.HK44"&gt;http://doi.org/10.7484/INSPIREHEP.DATA.A78C.HK44&lt;/a&gt;.  If you click,
the DOI will "resolve" to the INSPIRE record for this specific dataset
(not the paper).  From this record you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download the data from the "Files" tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check which papers are citing this dataset from the "Citation" tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow the link to the original paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;export a properly formatted citation to the dataset itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--![image]( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rA32o66Z3Wo/Ukri72OW3WI/AAAAAAAAAGI/cFxa7tghFpg/s1600/InspireDataRecord.png)--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="//2.bp.blogspot.com/-rA32o66Z3Wo/Ukri72OW3WI/AAAAAAAAAGI/cFxa7tghFpg/s1600/InspireDataRecord.png" width="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to data coming from HepData, INSPIRE now supports data
hosted in other third-party data repositories such
as &lt;a href="http://figshare.com/"&gt;Figshare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://thedata.org/"&gt;The Dataverse Network&lt;/a&gt;.  To test this out, I
put &lt;a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/21804"&gt;some data&lt;/a&gt; from a phenomenological study of the CMSSM onto
Dataverse -- yes, theorists create data too!  In this case, Dataverse
issued the persistent identifier to our data since they take on the
responsibility to store it.   I sent the persistent identifier to
INSPIRE and now it shows up in the data tab of our &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/749860/"&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt;.
 INSPIRE can now track citations to this data, which is hosted remotely.
 Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last example comes from a not-so-high-energy experiment I was
involved in called APEX  at &lt;a href="https://www.jlab.org/"&gt;Jefferson Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which is searching for
evidence of a 5th fundamental force of nature together with similar
experiments such as DarkLight, HPS, and MAMI. Unlike the enormous LHC
experiments, &lt;a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/experiment/APEX/"&gt;APEX&lt;/a&gt; had 66 collaborators that contributed to the
test-run for this small, special-purpose experiment. The results of the
test run were &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/923960/"&gt;published in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, and this week the &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/923960/hepdata"&gt;raw mass
distribution&lt;/a&gt; from those 770,509 events collected by APEX was released
directly on INSPIRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three examples illustrate the diversity of data in HEP ranging
from low-level experimental data, to theoretical predictions, to the
results of statistical analysis.  They also demonstrate the richness of
the data layer and the need for a robust information system.  Looking to
the future, we can imagine an extended author profile that includes
details on datasets analogous to what we are already have with papers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="physics"></category><category term="open science"></category></entry><entry><title>Inspired by the Higgs, a step forward in open access</title><link href="http://theoryandpractice.org/2013/09/inspired-by-the-higgs-a-step-forward-in-open-access/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-13T13:31:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-09-13T13:31:00+02:00</updated><author><name>cranmer</name></author><id>tag:theoryandpractice.org,2013-09-13:/2013/09/inspired-by-the-higgs-a-step-forward-in-open-access/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[originally posted on &lt;a href="http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2013/09/12/inspired-by-the-higgs-a-step-forward-in-open-access/"&gt;Quantum Diaries&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the Higgs boson is a major step forward in our
understanding of nature at the most fundamental levels. In addition to
being the last piece of the standard model, it is also at the core of
the fine tuning problem -- one of the deepest mysteries in particle
physics. So it is only natural that our scientific methodology rise to
the occasion to provide the most powerful and complete analysis of this
breakthrough discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the ATLAS collaboration has taken an important step forward by
making the likelihood function for three key measurements about the
Higgs available to the world digitally. Furthermore, this data is being
shared in a way that represents a template for how particle physics
operates in the fast-evolving world of open access to data. These steps
are a culmination of decades of work, so allow me to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="//www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Higgs-production-horizontal.png" width="500" title=""Four interactions that can produced a Higgs boson at the LHC"" alt=""Four interactions that can produced a Higgs boson at the LHC""&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, what are the three key measurements, and why are they
important? The three results were presented by ATLAS in &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1241574"&gt;this recent
paper&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, they are measurements for how often the Higgs is
produced at the LHC through different types of interactions (shown
above) and how often it decays into three different force carrying
particles (photons, W, and Z bosons). In this plot, the black + sign at
(1,1) represents the standard model prediction and the three sets of
contours represent the measurements performed by ATLAS. These
measurements are fundamental tests of the standard model and any
deviation could be a sign of new physics like supersymmetry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so what is the likelihood function, and why is it useful? Here maybe
it is best to give a little bit of history. In 2000, &lt;a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/411537?ln=en"&gt;the first in a
series of workshops&lt;/a&gt; was held at CERN where physicists gathered to
discuss the details of our statistical procedures that lead to the final
results of our experiments. Perhaps surprisingly, there is no unique
statistical procedure, and there is a lot of debate about the merits of
different approaches. After a long discussion panel, Massimo Corradi cut
to the point&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that there is a general consensus that what is really
meaningful for an experiment is likelihood, and almost everybody would
agree on the prescription that experiments should give their
likelihood function for these kinds of results. Does everybody agree
on this statement, to publish likelihoods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as Louis Lyons charred the session...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any disagreement? Carried unanimously. That's actually quite an
achievement for this workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, the likelihood function is the essential piece of
information needed for communicating scientific results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened next? Well... for years, despite unanimous support,
experiments still do not publish their likelihood functions. Part of the
reason is that we lacked the underlying technology to communicate these
likelihood functions efficiently. In the run up to the LHC we developed
some technology (associated to RooFit and RooStats) for being able to
share &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/12/08/making-the-higgs-sausage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CosmicVariance+%28Cosmic+Variance%29#.UjCw8RYZ6uA"&gt;very complicated likelihood functions&lt;/a&gt; internally. This would
be the ideal way to share our likelihood functions, but we aren't quite
there yet. In January 2013, we had &lt;a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=218693%20"&gt;a conference devoted to the topic of
publishing likleihood functions&lt;/a&gt;, which culminated in a paper &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1244142%20"&gt;"On the
presentation of LHC Higgs results"&lt;/a&gt;. This paper, written by theorist
and experimentalists, singled out the likelihood associated to the plot
above as the most useful way of communicating information about the
Higgs properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="//www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Test-kVkF-contours.png" width="400" title=""An overlay of the original ATLAS result (filled contours) and those reproduced from the official ATLAS likelihood functions."" alt=""An overlay of the original ATLAS result (filled contours) and those reproduced from the official ATLAS likelihood functions.""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that these specific Higgs plots are so useful is that more
specific tests of the standard model can be derived from them. For
instance, one might want to consider beyond the standard model theories
where the Higgs interacts with all the matter particles (fermions) or
all the force carrying particles (vector bosons) differently than in the
standard model. To do that, it is useful to group together all of the
information in a particular way and take a special 2-d slice through the
6-d parameter space described by the three 2-d plots above. To the left
is the result of this test (where the axes are called κ_F and κ_V for
the vector bosons and fermions, respectively). What is special about
this plot is that there is an overlay of the original ATLAS result
(filled contours) and those reproduced from the official ATLAS
likelihood functions. While my student Sven Kreiss made the comparison
as part of a test, anyone can now reproduce this plot from the official
ATLAS likelihood functions. More importantly, the same procedure that
was used to make this plot can be used to test other specific theories
-- and there are a lot of alternative ways to reinterpret these Higgs
results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! So where can you find these likelihood functions and what does
this have to do with open access? I think this part is very exciting.
CERN is now famous for being the &lt;a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/birth-web"&gt;birthplace for the world wide web&lt;/a&gt;
and having a forward-looking &lt;a href="http://library.web.cern.ch/oa/policy"&gt;vision for open access&lt;/a&gt; to our published
papers. The sheer volume and complexity of the LHC data makes the
conversation about open access to the raw data quite complicated.
However, having access to our published results is much less
controversial. While it is not done consistently, there are several
examples of experiments putting information that goes into tables and
figures on &lt;a href="http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk"&gt;HepData&lt;/a&gt; (a repository for particle physics measurements).
Recently, our literature system &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/"&gt;INSPIRE&lt;/a&gt; started to integrate with
HepData so that the data are directly associated to the original
publication (here is an &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1228693/hepdata"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;). What is important is that this
data is discoverable and citable. If someone uses this data, we want to
know exactly what is being used and the collaborations that produced the
data deserve some credit. INSPIRE is now issuing a &lt;a href="http://www.doi.org"&gt;Digital Object
Identifier&lt;/a&gt; (DOI) to this data, which is a persistent and trackable
link to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now for the fun part, you can go over to the INSPIRE record for the
recent Higgs paper (&lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1241574"&gt;http://inspirehep.net/record/1241574&lt;/a&gt;) and you will
see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="//www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Inspire-record-higgs.png" width="600" title=""The INSPIRE record for the recent ATLAS Higgs paper."" alt=""The INSPIRE record for the recent ATLAS Higgs paper.""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click on &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1241574/hepdata"&gt;HepData tab&lt;/a&gt; at the top it will take you to a list of
data associated to this paper. Each of the three entries has a DOI
associated to it (and lists all the ATLAS authors). For example, the
H→γγ result's DOI is &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.7484/INSPIREHEP.DATA.A78C.HK44"&gt;10.7484/INSPIREHEP.DATA.A78C.HK44&lt;/a&gt;, and this is
what should be &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1253646/export/hx"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; for any result that uses this likelihood.
(Note, to get to the actual data, you click on the Files tab.) INSPIRE
is now working so that your author profile will not only include all of
your papers, but also the data sets that you are associated with (here's
an&lt;a href="https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&amp;amp;cc=Data&amp;amp;p=100%3A+0000-0002-5769-7094&amp;amp;action_search=Search"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; in it's early form based on &lt;a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5769-7094"&gt;my ORCID ID&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="//www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/INSPIRE-H-gamgam.png" width="600" title=""The H to two photon likelihood function."" alt=""The H to two photon likelihood function.""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's time for me and my co-authors to update our paper &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1244142%20"&gt;"On the
presentation of LHC Higgs results"&lt;/a&gt; to cite this data. And next week,
Salvatore Mele, head of Open Access at CERN, will give a &lt;a href="http://datacite.eventbrite.co.uk"&gt;keynote
presentation&lt;/a&gt; to the DataCite conference entitled "A short history of
the Higgs Boson. From a tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big
Bang, through the discovery at CERN, to a DataCite DOI".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly hope that this becomes standard practice for the LHC. It is a
real milestone for the information architecture associated to the field
of high energy physics and a step forward in the global analysis of the
Higgs boson discovered at the LHC!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="higgs"></category><category term="physics"></category><category term="open science"></category></entry><entry><title>Visiting my high school in Arkansas</title><link href="http://theoryandpractice.org/2013/08/visiting-my-high-school-in-arkansas/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-21T20:41:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-21T20:41:00+02:00</updated><author><name>cranmer</name></author><id>tag:theoryandpractice.org,2013-08-21:/2013/08/visiting-my-high-school-in-arkansas/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Originally posted at &lt;a href="http://www.quantumdiaries.org/author/kyle-cranmer/"&gt;Quantum Diaries&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I will be going to visit my high school in Arkansas.  It was
20 years ago that the school first opened its doors and I was part of
that Charter class.  The &lt;a href="http://asmsa.org/about"&gt;Arkansas School for Mathematics, Science &amp;amp; the
Arts&lt;/a&gt; is a bit unusual, it is "one of only fifteen public, residential
high schools in the country specializing in the education of gifted and
talented students who have an interest and aptitude for mathematics
and science."  And this was a state-wide school, so it was a lot like
leaving for college two years early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkansas is not particularly well known for its educational system -- as
a kid we would joke "thank god for Mississippi" when Arkansas would come
in 49/50th in some educational ranking.  My brother attended Little
Rock's Central High, which is famous for its history in the civil rights
movement and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine"&gt;desegregation&lt;/a&gt; of the school system).  I'm happy to
see that Arkansas is &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/01/10/16sos.h32.html?tkn=RLRF%2B4mUV1fjxGZAPk7Od%2FfW1p2K2SFHTAx9&amp;amp;cmp=clp-edweek&amp;amp;intc=EW-QC13-EWH"&gt;doing better in the educational rankings&lt;/a&gt;, but
there is still a long way to go.  For those of you not from the US, I've
included a map showing this rural state in the southern part of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school has an interesting history, it was created in 1991 by an act
of the Arkansas Legislature.  Bill Clinton was Governor of Arkansas at
the time, and I happened to get a photo with him that year in his office
(wearing my friend's hideous sweater, since my clothes were all dirty
while playing at his house).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the school is more closely modeled after the &lt;a href="%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_School_of_Science_and_Mathematics"&gt;North Carolina
School of Science and Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, one of the other early schools of
this type was the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Mathematics_and_Science_Academy#History"&gt;Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's
a tidbit from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_M._Lederman" title="Leon M. Lederman"&gt;Leon Lederman&lt;/a&gt;, director emeritus of nearby &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermilab" title="Fermilab"&gt;Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavia,_Illinois" title="Batavia, Illinois"&gt;Batavia, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, was among
the first to propose the Illinois school in 1982, and together with
Governor &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_R._Thompson" title="James R. Thompson"&gt;Jim Thompson&lt;/a&gt; led the effort for its creation. Thompson
has noted with pride that he chose to build IMSA instead of competing
for the ill-fated &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_Super_Collider" title="Superconducting Super Collider"&gt;supercollider&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This school changed my life.  I learned calculus and calculus-based
physics from Dr. Irina Lyublinskaya, a Russian-educated Ph.D. physicist
that had left Russia due to religious persecution.  I took an organic
chemistry in high school with awesome labs where we extracted DNA from
plants and ran gel electrophoresis.  I was frustrated by the lack of
activities, so I &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hoonynoo/2174018822/"&gt;got involved in school politics&lt;/a&gt;. But probably the
most important aspect of my time there was learning from my friends and
taking on all sorts of projects.  I learned some basic electronics from
my electronics guru friends Colin and  Stephen (who made a TV from a
scrap oscilloscope), my friend Thomas made a pretty nice Tesla Coil, we
used to get in trouble making &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BGkUBmN9GU"&gt;potato guns&lt;/a&gt; and I almost lost an eye
with a rail gun trial.  I remember making a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)"&gt;binary half adder&lt;/a&gt; out of
some huge &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay"&gt;old telphone relay switches&lt;/a&gt;, and when I connected the
current the you could hear the simple computation proceed
knock-knock-knock until the lights at the end of the big piece of
plywood I was using lit up to confirm 1+2=3.  My friend Sean taught me
about programming, my friend Colin taught me about Neural Networks and
Fast Fourier Transforms.  I spent weeks soldering together
an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"&gt;EEG&lt;/a&gt; for my science fair project to identify different classes of
thought by using brain waves and identifying them by analyzing their
characteristic frequency spectrum with a neural network -- an idea I got
while watching a documentary of Stephen Hawking.  And we were all
on-line and exposed to the world wide web in its formative years
(93-95).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I leave to go visit the school 20 years later.  We will meet
with legislators, parents, alumni, students, and supporters.  I look
forward to telling the students about the tremendously exciting career
I've had in particle physics, culminating in the discovery of the Higgs
boson.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A fresh look for the standard model</title><link href="http://theoryandpractice.org/2013/08/a-fresh-look-for-the-standard-model/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-09T19:40:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-09T19:40:00+02:00</updated><author><name>cranmer</name></author><id>tag:theoryandpractice.org,2013-08-09:/2013/08/a-fresh-look-for-the-standard-model/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been more involved in communication, education, and

outreach activities via the &lt;a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/august-2013/physicists-chart-path-forward"&gt;"Snowmass" Community Summer Study&lt;/a&gt;.  One
of the goals we discussed was to get to the point that the public is
more aware of the fundamental particles.  Ideally, we'd like something
as iconic as the periodic table (which is rotated from &lt;a href="http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/resources/periodictable/pre16/develop/mendeleev.htm"&gt;Mendeleev's
original&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="//www.chemicool.com/images/periodic-table.png" width="400"&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our standard graphic for the standard model builds on this tabular
format, which is not unreasonable with the three generations of fermions
for the columns and rows pointing to the up/down pairing of the SU(2)
symmetry in the weak force.  It's a cute graphic, but it has a number of
problems for communicating with the public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Higgs is absent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 3-d effect is meaningless and is second only to our notorious
    use of Comic Sans for painting physicists as being inept in the
    graphic design department&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/standardmodel-standard.jpg" width="300"&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems easy enough to add the Higgs to this table, but there seems no
agreement on where to put it as you can see from &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=standard+model"&gt;Google's image
search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/SM-confusion.jpg" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a physicists point of view there are some other problems that
actually harm those starting to learn the standard model for real&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there symmetry for the strong force (the RGB colors of the quarks)
    is not reflected at all leading to the idea that there is only one
    type of up quark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the complications about the left- and right- handed parts of the
    leptons in the weak interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mixing between the quarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rows and columns don't mean anything for the force carriers,
    and any sort of group-theoretic structure for the gauge bosons is
    missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, I went to the &lt;a href="http://sheffdocfest.com"&gt;Sheffield Documentary Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; for the
screening of &lt;a href="http://www.particlefever.com/PF/"&gt;Particle Fever&lt;/a&gt;.  It's a great film that humanizes
fundamental particle physics in an emotional, funny, and romantic way.
 It also has some great graphics.  One of my favorite parts was this new
way of representing the fundamental particles.  David Kaplan sent me
&lt;a href="http://theoryandpractice.org/images/Standard-Model.jpg"&gt;this mockup&lt;/a&gt;, that it looks like he made in Keynote, and I  had my own go
at it with some different fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Particle-Fever-Standard-Model-Graphic.png" width="400"&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I like about it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it looks complete (which the standard model is in a certain sense),
    unlike like a table that can keep being appended with rows and
    columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 13px;"&gt;it has a fresh, flat design that
    lends itself way to an iconic image (stickers, t-shirts,
    etc.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is minimal, but it still has some basic structure&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rings of fermions, vector bosons, scalar (Higgs) boson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quarks/leptons are top/bottom or red/green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;families are still there in the clockwise orientation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Higgs is central (I'm kind of kidding, but the Higgs is a
    unique, central part of the theory and it has gathered a huge amount
    of attention to the field)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the graphic is not perfect.  I've thought about variations.
 For instance, rearranging the fermions from a clockwise oriented flow
to a left/right and top/bottom symmetry for the quark/lepton and weak
force (SU(2) doublet) structure.  One could play with color a bit so
that the up/down-type quarks and leptons have a common coloring in some
way.  However, all of these changes also can be given the same criticism
I gave the standard standard model graphic at the top.  For instance,
focusing on the weak interaction over the strong interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the graphic near the end of this trailer for Particle Fever,
where it then gets dressed up with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling"&gt;Penrose tiling&lt;/a&gt; and some
supersymmetric friends.&lt;/p&gt;

statistics lectures to the CERN summer school&lt;/a&gt;. I played around with
&lt;a href="http://d3js.org"&gt;d3.js&lt;/a&gt;, a cool javascript library for doing data visualization in the
browser. I also wanted to learn &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt;, a python based web
micro-framework. I got &lt;a href="http://flask.theoryandpractice.org"&gt;my first non-trivial flask+d3 example going&lt;/a&gt;
and put it up here on &lt;a href="https://github.com/cranmer/flask-d3-hello-world"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Just to make my self super-trendy,
hipster, data scientist guy I also ditched emacs for &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com"&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/a&gt;.
This is actually a huge change given that I'm a power-user in emacs and
can do some pretty cool keyboard macros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was there I met with Salvatore Mele and Sünje Dallmeier-Tiessen
from &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net"&gt;INSPIRE&lt;/a&gt; and CERN open science initiatives. Some exciting things
on the front of presenting LHC results, perhaps publishing 2-d profile
likelihoods (slices of Higgs likelihoods in thousands of dimensions).
It's amazing how the model independent (cross-section)_i x (branching
ratio)_j contours (for i={VBF+WH, ggF+ttH} and j={WW, ZZ, γγ})&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are sufficient statistics for for a number of benchmark-model coupling

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I just finished  the process of uploading data from
a &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/749860"&gt;phenomenology paper I worked on a few years ago&lt;/a&gt; where we did a big
MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) scan of the CMSSM (Constrained Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model). So far I've uploaded it to both
&lt;a href="http://figshare.com"&gt;Figshare&lt;/a&gt; and to the &lt;a href="http://thedata.org"&gt;Harvard Dataverse Network&lt;/a&gt;. I think I'm going
to go with Dataverse though Figshare has been very nice. I'm choosing
Dataverse mainly b/c of attention to meta-data and ability to launch a
branded instances of the site. Though it did take me a hours to get the
upload to work and it only took about 10 seconds to upload it on
Figshare. Also, I want a nice API to tabular data so that I can link it
with &lt;a href="http://d3js.org"&gt;d3.js&lt;/a&gt;... neither have it, but FigShare's seems further behind
(surprisingly b/c they are much more "2.0"-ish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've released my first dataset today (July 12, 2013) and it's here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranmer, Kyle; Allanach, Ben; Lester, Christopher; Weber, Arne,
"Replication data for: "Natural Priors, CMSSM Fits and LHC Weather
Forecasts"", &lt;a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/21804"&gt;hdl:1902.1/21804&lt;/a&gt; UNF:5:bvw2MoOATltX0yfGjF9hJQ== V1
[Version]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to it and click on one of the TabularData entries you can even
do some minimal analysis from the web. Like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="KISMET scan" src="http://theoryandpractice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/KISMET-scan-300x187.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish they would give me a little gist-style embed like this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/defunkt/202314.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that's a lot of playing around with new things of late. I hope
to see the &lt;a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/21804"&gt;DataVerse handle&lt;/a&gt; associated to &lt;a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/749860"&gt;the

some aspect of Zope that most of my projects only worked out with the
help of friends like Sean, Joe, Jeff, Bob, and Stephen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://old.theoryandpractice.org"&gt;old theoryandpractice&lt;/a&gt; site ran on Zope, but it hasn't been
touched in years.  I spent so much time getting a 3-collumn CSS layout
back in the early CSS days that it basically killed my interest.  Now
I'm rebooting theoryandpractice.org (love that name) with wordpress and
I'm hoping to tinker with some of the new technologies like D3
and &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A D3 Test post using iframe</title><link href="http://theoryandpractice.org/2013/06/a-d3-test-post-using-iframe/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-28T18:21:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-06-28T18:21:00+02:00</updated><author><name>cranmer</name></author><id>tag:theoryandpractice.org,2013-06-28:/2013/06/a-d3-test-post-using-iframe/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick test of inserting an HTML file with some &lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;D3 magic&lt;/a&gt; into a
